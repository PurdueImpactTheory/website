                I am a sophomore majoring in physics with minor areas of business French, math, and astronomy. Being in physics, my main goal has become communicating all the nuanced but amazing parts of this discipline to my friends and peers. 
                <br><br>
                The first project I plan to tackle is creating a YouTube video series that can be incorporated into middle school or high school science curriculum that hints to awesome physics concepts.  Also, if you love frogs almost as much as you love puns, we have a lot in common!

                    I'm a sophomore studying computer science with a minor in Spanish! A project I'm looking into is how to reduce the learning curve required to learn various programming languages or related techniques. Hopefully this will promote greater interest in learning how to code among younger students.

                    I'm also a die-hard Carly Rae Jepsen fan, so expect to hear a lot of her music around me!                </div>

                I am a sophomore majoring in Biological Engineering with a Cellular and Molecular Concentration along with a minor in Biotechnology and Computer Science. I've always had a passion for making a meaningful impact on my community. 
                Before coming to Purdue, I volunteered at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. Now I'm taking my teaching experience from the East Coast to the Midwest!

                My project idea is to help students who struggle with mental health diseases get the help they need to be successful in the classroom.
