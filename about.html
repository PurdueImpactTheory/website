                    The <b>Purdue Impact Theory</b> provides a niche for rising scientists to communicate to the public what science means to them. 
                    We care most about communicating what scientists do; who they are; how scientific discovery works; 
                    what applications science has in the world; and most importantly, how we all can engage with science throughout our lives.
                    <br><br>
                    Our projects reflect our members’ diverse interests. These include on-campus events, community outreach activities, 
                    college curriculum proposals, high school educator networking, high school student outreach, online resources for 
                    educators and students, and YouTube video series.

                    The idea started between the original President and Treasurer who would discuss issues with the way physics was perceived in society. Most people they encountered pitied them having to pursue physics in college, seeming to believe it was just memorizing equations.                 </p>

                    It soon became evident that similar misunderstandings existed for all types of science majors, which sparked the concept for the PIT.  After spreading the idea to some close friends and faculty, it caught on and became an organization of about ten members and two faculty at its conception.

                    The PIT was created in the fall of 2017 with a group of students ranging in backgrounds across nearly all science majors. Since their recognition as a Purdue student organization, members of the PIT have worked to make their presence more aware on campus and to the community.
