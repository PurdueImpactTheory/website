                    It soon became evident that similar misunderstandings existed for all types of science majors, which sparked the concept for the PIT.  After spreading the idea to some close friends and faculty, it caught on and became an organization of about ten members and two faculty at its conception.

                    The PIT was created in the fall of 2017 with a group of students ranging in backgrounds across nearly all science majors. Since their recognition as a Purdue student organization, members of the PIT have worked to make their presence more aware on campus and to the community.
